NEAR-ETH token interoperability
NOTE: PLEASE switch to branch newx for working demo code

This project demonstrates a basic token swap: It allows you to mint 1 N-ETH on the NEAR blockchain, for every Wei deposited in a designated ethereum contract. In turn, upon burning these N-ETH, the ETH in the designated contract is released back to the sender(or to any ETH address of the burner's choice).

With very minor changes, this could be used to carry out a 1:1 swap of any ERC20 token on the ethereum blockchain to a corresponding N-Token. The user workflow in our design is as follows:

1. Deposit Ether to Ethereum contract: [0xc966Ba2a41888B6B4c5273323075B98E27B9F364]

2. NEAR contract oracle detects deposited ETH. [Done] Video Demo: https://youtu.be/GkloVRmMz8U

3. NEAR contract resets "TotalSupply" of N-ETH to match the total supply of locked ETH. [Done - newx3 branch]

4. N-ETH tokens can be freely exchanged on NEAR Blockchain. [Done, untested - newx3 branch]

5. N-ETH can be burnt by specifying a ETH address to return the collateral ETH [Ethereum contract] [WIP]


Getting started
There are two ways to run this project. The first is the quick and a good way to instantly become familiar with this example. Once familiar, the next step is for a developer to create their own NEAR account and deploy the contract to testnet. This is covered in the following section.

There's a button at the top of this file that says "Open in Gitpod." This will open the project in a new tab with an integrated development environment. The other option is to clone this repository and follow the same instructions.

Quickest option
Install dependencies:
yarn
Build and deploy this smart contract to a development account. This development account will be created automatically and is not intended for reuse:
yarn dev
Your command line which will display a link to localhost similar to:

Server running at http://localhost:1234
Please open that link your browser to continue and see how to log in with NEAR Wallet in a simple webapp.

Standard deploy option
In this second option, the smart contract will get deployed to a specific account created with the NEAR Wallet.

Ensure near-shell is installed by running:
near --version
If needed, install near-shell:

npm install near-shell -g
If you do not have a NEAR account, please create one with NEAR Wallet.
In the project root, login with near-shell by following the instructions after this command:

near login
Modify the top of src/config.js, changing the CONTRACT_NAME to be the NEAR account that was just used to log in.
…
const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE'; /* TODO: fill this in! */
…
Start the example!
yarn start
To Test
yarn asp // as-pect tests
yarn jest // integration tests
yarn test // both
